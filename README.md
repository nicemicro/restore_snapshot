# restore_snapshot
Restore Snapper BTRFS snapshot of a file.
Currently it uses dmenu to give the user a menu with all available snapshots.

You can call it directly from the shell, or place the script with the nemo_action file in .local/share/nemo/actions to use it as a Nemo Action in your Nemo file browser.
